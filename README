Swiss JS
========

Swiss JS is a Javascript Framework Framework.  

> This library is not maintained and should not be used. The JS world is much better now :)

It's usefulness is mainly for higher-level framework developers who want to support
multiple JS frameworks with their applications or components.  Beyond that, it 
adds an extra layer of abstraction that you may not want for your application if you've
chosen a specific library and you love it.  However, if you'd like to have support
for multiple libraries or you'd like to have a shield in your application - Swiss 
might just do the job for you.

Right now, it's in early initial development and not ready for prime time.

Here's how you'd use it:

<html>
<head>
<script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="swiss.js" type="type/javascript"></script>
<script src="swiss-jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="foo"></div>
	<script>
		swiss("#foo").html("hello,world").css("border","1px solid red");
	</script>
</body>
<html>


Swiss works through a tiny adapter for each framework.  The adapter knows how to 
take swiss API calls and adapt them to the respective framework and return 
swiss-style results.


We're not going to try and provide full abstraction for every feature in all 
JS frameworks. That would defeat the purpose of Swiss.  However, we're going to 
try and provide common JS functionality such as:

- Ajax
- CSS / Attributes
- Element / Selectors
- Animations
- Onload / Unload
- Events

================

- Mainly, the JS frameworks themselves.  For all the wonderful variations of 
code that our community keeps asking us to support!

- John Resig and JQuery for the stylistic design we are adopting for swiss

- Ivo Beckers for his constant prompting for this functionality in Appcelerator

- Microsoft for it's completely horrid implementation of Web Standards such as 
HTML and CSS and its ability to innovate - making JS frameworks more important than ever.


Swiss is free and open source.  You can use it in your projects - commercial or free.
